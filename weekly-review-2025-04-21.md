- Test 1 was Multibrach Jenkins
- Issue was with the Token, added to credintials
- But that was giving error, to fix that we did add it to the credentials in the folder part of multibranch pipeline, and that worked.
- In the process from AWS side we need to have access to IAM and we need to create a token for External user there.


  Next step to do - 
  1. Bounce a EC2 instance from there
  2. Create a security group
  3. Create a key
